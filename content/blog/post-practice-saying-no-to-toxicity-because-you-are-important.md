I grew up in a village and was nurtured in a traditional, extremely considerate, and almost submissive small-town girl-raising environment in the 2000s. By the way, I am a millennial.

> I was raised by a strong, traditional woman who gave me wings to fly the highest while keeping me extremely grounded. Hence, ironically, I still struggle to understand cunningness, manipulation, and toxicity even in my early 30s. 

Looking back about a decade ago, I never had time to understand any of these. I was too busy to study, work, and commute because I wanted to create my own identity, as I was all on my own. Today, I can say with humble gratitude that I could manage to do something for myself, by myself, with my mother being a solid backbone over the years, with sheer hard work, persistence, and minding my business. But many times, I feel that I have a lot to learn in managing toxicity, assertiveness, and prioritizing everything, including many people. Let me share one of the experiences with you that took me years to understand and grasp the call I took. Many times, I feel I am too sensitive in a not-so-sensitive world.

spontaneityI had a colleague cum friend who I used to respect dearly. I used to consider her a sister. However, she was (is) a self-proclaimed righteous, truthful, and problem-solver. I lost my confidence, spontaneity, and identity in my three years in her company. It is safe to say I began to fall into depression and had been struggling with a severe identity crisis. Still, one fine day, that toxic woman ended our friendship with a huge fuss owing to the wrongful stories (typical office politics), she had been told about me from others around. I was shocked and overwhelmed. When in reality, she was not only dominating my personal and professional life but had done everything to create a ‘good image’ of herself in front of our senior by backbiting about me at the cost of my sincerity, work dedication, and hard work that I had been putting into my work. She was a source of such negativity that everyone would feel disgusted with her presence but wouldn’t say it to her face since she was a resourceful person who couldn’t be messed with.

So, when she broke off all the strings with me since we became almost family friends, she began daily show-off of public humiliation for me. It turned into a naturally hostile environment with which I had to deal daily. Despite all the nonsense going on around, I had been dealing with all the shit with maturity, kindness, and patience because (maybe something is wrong with me that I could not stoop to her level?) I never wanted to forget that she stood by my side during the most troublesome time of my life.

However, I forgot how painful, toxic, and nerve-wracking it is to uphold one’s moral values, showcase maturity and let go of everything thrown at you only because you are a genuinely good human being. And it all began to reflect on my mental health. 

> Every morning was becoming a challenge for me, and every evening was another forceful endeavour to prepare myself for the following day. I can never forget those critical times when, besides this nonsense, I was also targeted in the typical workplace politics. I had almost lost the balance between my mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical self.

After years of being in these stinging waters, now when I am beginning to realize it is good to be a good human being, but, believe me, not everyone around deserves your humane, kind, and benevolent self. I still struggle to put this realization into practice, though. I am starting to learn how not to hurt and harm myself again with my good qualities. Now, in toxic situations, I listen to the rubbish once and try to let it go. But when I understand a person's wicked and cunning nature, I never take it again. I either distance myself from them. I silently and intentionally widen the gap with them. Over the years, I understood that people love to spread their insecurities, weaknesses, and negativity to others with their words and actions. Sometimes, they victimise themselves to make you feel guilty for being intelligent, knowledgeable, and talented. Too much price to maintain such so-called 'friendship'.

Hence, friends, please beware and be watchful of such nuisance-kind people, whether at your workplace, home or institutes. I hope you will not make the mistake I have been making for so long that now I have to make conscious efforts to regain peace and sanity, which is not at all the road that you might want to walk, believe me. Please prioritize your health and sanity, particularly mental health, over the misconception of displaying maturity where it is NOT NEEDED.

> Be sane and take care of yourself because self-care matters. You matter. And it is alright, in fact, better NOT to have this kind of creature in life. Never, indeed, as friends because friends uplift you and not pull you down.
