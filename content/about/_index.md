I am an academic, researcher, translator, blogger, poet and writer-in making. I write to take an honest look within, to understand the vacuum I feel, when fail to express what is going on within. Although all of us lead different and opposite lives, there is always something that binds us all in a thread -the emotional upheaval. I figured there could be many like myself who may fail to say what they feel like and unlike me, may not have a way to express themselves. Hence, I am writing all that I feel in black and white, loud and clear, to create an inclusive e-community where we lead this exclusive rollercoaster journey of life inclusively, together. To, express, share, learn, unlearn, and re-learn the ways of leading life, distantly together!
