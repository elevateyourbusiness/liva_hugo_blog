[{"categories":["Personal Development"],"contents":"Hey!\nHope you’re doing well and keeping safe.\nI’ve been in a non-active mode for a while. However, irrespective of what you feel, the world continues to exist and so do the experiences that we get en route. So was the case with me. I have had some intriguing experiences recently and these current experiences took me back into the past, where I had been through similar kinds of experiences. It had brought a sort of deep and blank silence and anxiety to me back then and the same happened to me now, too.\nLet’s come to the point without much do.\nI am going to talk about a specific kind of people who are really good at enacting ‘victim’ after playing their cunning, shrewd, and manipulative schemes on you and hurt you deeply because you stop letting them manipulate you, use you and let them control your life.\nLet me elaborate. You are a smart, intelligent, and sincerely hardworking yet humble person at the professional as well as personal fronts. You believe in the healthy competition being a team player. You believe in the goodness of heart when it comes to handling people around you. Thus, you always give them the benefit of doubt, whenever they misbehave or cross their limit of decency. But, let me tell you, after a careful observation at the later stage when I was coming out of the anxiety, I have realized that these kinds of people are everywhere. They take maximum advantage of your intelligence, knowledge, and skills, try to copy you, use and extremely manipulate you at the personal and professional levels, and consider you a fool. Interestingly enough, the moment you show them their limits in a black and white manner, they play the victim. They create a scenario around in a manner where others may believe that you have done something really bad and wrong to them. You have deeply offended and ill-treated them. All the while, they still have been keeping their goodness.\nI have developed a deep disgust around such people. Such are the people who make you question yourself, your individual characteristics, your very nature, your kindness, honesty, and humbleness and put you in a situation where you begin to justify to your own self that you have not done anything wrong. You have just humble (still humbly yet upfront) made it clear that they can’t interfere and dominate your life, whether personal or professional.\nIt is also to be considered that you never unnecessarily interfere in anyone’s life. You never judge them. You mind your business and never poke your nose in anyone’s personal or professional life. Because you understand that human beings are capable of thinking and taking their decisions independently. Common sense says, everyone is capable of leading their life, in their own individual manner and style. No one, unless requested, requires pointless, extra, unsolicited life advice. Yet, you entertain their nonsense assistances for so long (to ensure they shouldn’t feel bad, if told that I am more than capable enough to handle my life, my way, without your rubbish recommendations and counsel) that a ‘NO’ coming from you leave them uneasy.\nIt hurts their ego to know that how can someone be smarter, intelligent, knowledgeable yet humble? Why are they no more needed to dominate your life? How can you clarify and set healthy boundaries for yourself? How can you begin to realize, understand and acknowledge your self-worth because it is costing you mental disturbance? How dare you not entertain their bullshit and arrogance? How come their enforced and illogical, half-knowledgeable info is unwelcomed now? That too from a person who has always been gentle, considerate, and modest with them? The person who has never hurt their ego because you understand self-esteem is dear to all.\n","permalink":"https://livahugoblog.netlify.app/blog/blog-1/","tags":["Self-Worth","Personal Growth","Self-Esteem"],"title":"The Art of Consciously Understanding Your Self-Worth: 1"},{"categories":["Blog Writing","Diary","Inspiration","Life and Experiences","Long-form","Musing","Philosophy","Raeesa Writes"],"contents":"I hail from a small village in Gujarat and was allowed to pursue further studies as a meritorious female student. Thanks to my parents, who stood up for me against challenging odds in the family and village. I was among a handful of girls in my village to get that opportunity over the years. I started travelling for studies. I couldn’t think beyond studies, actively participating in competitions, winning and losing, but moving forward, humbled and conscious of where I come from, using a fortunate opportunity denied to many of my fellow classmate girls because our village school offered education only till grade 10. We had to travel to a nearby village, about 5 kilometres away, for grades 11 and 12. For graduation, I went to a town about 20 kilometres away. Pursuing studies and travelling in public transport for a village girl is considered taboo even today when I am talking about the early 2000s.\nHence, it could never come to my mind to seek attention, take credit, or compete in the rat race. Villagers lack these “skills.” An introverted village girl has just been happy and excited over the chance to make her life. Ammi taught me ‘neki kar, dariya main daal’ – loosely translated as ‘do (deed) what you can and forget about it\\be discreet with your kindness’. I still firmly believe that ‘let your work speak for you.’ But the world around me is a huge crowd filled with varied people. An interesting kind is ‘Bolbachhans (bol+bachhan = talkers who cannot do anything, that’s why brag).’\nMy experience of over two decades made me realise that the community of Bolbachhans is increasing. They are often called free-riders, intimidators, expert braggers, leg-pullers, mean, self-centred and opportunists. Ironically, their success and happiness depend upon someone’s failure. Further, they Never Work or Contribute. But they are credit-takers for success and first to blame others for failure. They are troubled and internally unhappy people. Unfortunately, they thrive as sadists (sadists get pleasure out of other’s suffering). Please think of them now and laugh at them. They deserve it – Ha, ha, ha! What a pitiful life they have!\nI ask you to laugh off and move forward, but it is not easy in real life. Being around them and having to bear them daily is a challenge. They may make life so miserable for you that you may not want to leave your bed in the morning. They are attention seekers and insecure to the extent that they consciously won’t care how badly they are hurting someone’s self-worth, killing someone’s motivation and even taking away somebody’s job. How many people are crying, feeling lost, and questioning their potential because some opportunist has seeded self-doubt in them repeatedly?\nI see you. I hear you. I feel for you. Because I have been there, too. Despite minding my business, I have been bullied as a student at the hands of my junior during my Master’s course.\nEnglish department organised an international conference. As a sincere, class-ranking, and confident student, I was responsible for handling the stage between sessions to make small announcements in English for tea-lunch breaks and different venues with my junior, a full-of-herself girl. Despite being an excellent and confident orator and winning public speaking competitions, nervousness was natural because I came from a vernacular language (Gujarati) background. Speaking 3 sentences in English in a gathering of the professors of English felt like a gigantic challenge. But I was ready as always. However, the opportunity never came. She grabbed the mike, overshadowed me, and didn’t let me speak despite standing there and waiting for my turn. The repetitive, unspoken insult hit me so deep and hard that I left the event by the evening and skipped the next day. I called in with an excuse for sickness. But this was being observed by fellow students. They brought this issue to a faculty member. Madam called me in and softly enquired about it. I am not the kind that easily opens up or cries in public, but I broke down. Seeing me hurt so deeply she asked me to take the issue to our then-HoD. I don’t know why, but I denied it and asked her to let go. Nevertheless, the situation reached, sir. He first scolded me for not informing him of the entire narrative and silently being bullied. I still remember his words; he said, ‘Never leave a place because someone is insulting you. You are carrying the trust of those who trusted you. Inform them. You are not doing wrong to that girl but standing up for yourself. Never let anyone tell you what you are capable of. There is a reason why you were given the responsibility to handle the stage.” I left teary-eyed from there with a lesson for life.\nIt was in the 2011-2013. A decade later, today, I have created an identity, a place for myself. All by myself. As a curious learner, I have dedication, sincerity and an endless quest for knowledge as an academic. I can sleep peacefully at night when I receive genuine gratitude and acknowledgement from my students for adding value to their lives and being there for them. It is my earning. If this is not an achievement, what is it then?\nHence, feel and accept the roller-coaster phases of life. Try not to be an eraser that wipes out someone’s hard work. Just be there for yourself and remember,\nNeki kar, Dariya main daal and of course, stay awaaaaaaaaay from bolbachhans!!!!\nRecall the value you add to someone’s life. Remember that feeling.\nHave a mindfully relaxing weekend!!!!\n","permalink":"https://livahugoblog.netlify.app/blog/blog-2/","tags":["Bolbachhans","Bragging","Self-Reflection","Personal Growth","Life Lessons"],"title":"Bolbachhans: The Braggers, Not Doers"},{"categories":["Blog Writing","Diary","Inspiration","Life and Experiences","Long-form","Micro-tale","Musing","Philosophy","Raeesa Writes"],"contents":"Ups and downs, rise and fall, pick and pit, highest and lowest, whatever you name, are life’s inevitable parts. We all face hurdles, tests, and moments of trials and doubt in life. It’s natural to stumble and fall, pause and go invisible, but what truly matters is our ability to bounce back. It is what makes you stand out in the crowd.\nBelieving in yourself is not a cliché, as people generally call it. It is instead an essential building block for leading a healthy human life. You’re on the right path to resilience and achievement when you believe in your abilities and trust your capacity to overcome adversity. Also, don’t forget that stating these words is easier than implementing them in the routine. If you’re struggling there, remember we’re all sailing in the same boat. However, you have taken the first step to understand and recognise yourself as you are. Not seeing yourself through other’s eyes, perceptions and opinions.\nSelf-belief helps bring inner motivation to the fore. That thin, almost inaudible inner voice that says, “You can do it,” when the world seems to shout otherwise on your face -centre, left and right. When you believe in yourself, you can struggle through difficult times like a survivor. You begin to develop the resilience to face challenges head-on, knowing that failure is not the end but merely a stepping stone to growth and improvement. Remember, we can’t fail until we try.\nDetermination, trust and belief in ourselves are essential in shaping our mindset. A kind, positive, humane and self-assured outlook towards life and things opens doors to opportunities we barely consider. You become adaptive and let yourself embrace change, novelty and uncertainty with self-belief. It also prepares you to move forward, no matter how disappointed and discouraged you feel for days. It teaches you every day is a new day. We are allowed to do multiple trials and errors as human beings. We also, with time, develop an ability to look forward and get ready to accept an unplanned and sudden future, a sign that we are ready for an upward and new tomorrow.\nSelf-belief, friends, is contagious by nature, like happiness and sadness. Your smiley face may become the reason not only for your day to turn into a good one but also for those who cross paths with you. Friends, just remember that we never lose confidence. We never turn introverts in a fortnight. We don’t lose hope. We don’t fail as a person. We just become conscious and begin to note our surroundings and believe me, it is filled with insecurities, judgements and unhealthy competitions where you either win or lose. Learning and experience barely exist there. We let that gloom and negativity take us over ourselves.\nWe are still the same. For instance, you may lose brain memory in an unfortunate incident, but muscle memory can’t be wiped out. So is the case with us. We exhaust and overwhelm ourselves psychologically by looking at other’s success, progress and eternal happiness and cringe about our inability to compete with the fast-progressing, seemingly always-happy and always-successful world around us. Can you recall the last time you walked 10 minutes to the office or market or did a physically exhausting task? Also, we quickly forget that all of us are struggling in our little worlds. But nobody talks about it or acknowledges it, fearing random public judgements.\nWell, well, well, we still have life in us. We must try to accept it to its fullest -the ups and downs, lows and highs, curves and shapes. Instead of being afraid of failure, how about we consider it an experience, self-learning and a stepping stone?\nSpare a minute today and give this a thought. I am going to do the same.\nHappy Sunday!\n","permalink":"https://livahugoblog.netlify.app/blog/blog-3/","tags":["Self-Belief","Resilience","Determination","Positive Outlook","Life Lessons"],"title":"Cloudy Conversation with the Self"}]
