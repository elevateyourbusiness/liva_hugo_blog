Just try to understand it.\nI was pleasantly surprised and couldn’t help but smile with a painful throat, exhausted, sleepless mind, and drained body when I heard this sentence from an ENT specialist in Mahabub Nagar District, Hyderabad. It got me thinking: won’t life become easy and simple if we just learn to accept the process without rushing to decode everything that happens and try to understand life?\nI have had a cough and cold for a few weeks. My condition worsened because of my casualness towards health as I took it for granted as a regular climate change infection and kept delaying a doctor’s visit. Soon, I started coughing uncontrollably, had a fever and had many sleepless nights. In the process, I almost lost my voice. I could not speak at all for about three days. At this time, I realized what a big mistake I made. I rushed to the doctor – an ENT specialist, and was diagnosed with tonsilitis. The swelling was observed in my throat and nose area. The situation was so severe that I had to type the address and show it to Autowalla and the grocery stores because I had completely lost my voice.\nI am an academic. My job is to speak. Imagine a person’s situation who earns by speaking but can’t speak at all (hahaha, ironic, right?). Despite my severe condition, I was more worried about how quickly I could start talking because I couldn’t afford to keep cancelling my classes. At this moment also, I was more concerned about my professional responsibilities than my deteriorating health. I know I am unnecessarily sincere and prioritize my work more than my health.\nAnyway, amid these worries, the doctor’s simple and short sentence made me take a break from all my fears and think about how I had lost my patience. Ironically, I worried more about the external aspects than my physical and mental well-being.\nAll of these happened in the last week of December 2023 and continue to happen now, somewhere in the middle of the second week of January 2024.\nI just lost my voice, guys! What an exciting end to the year and the beginning of the new year! Phewwwww! It also gave me a relatively easy and straightforward New Year\u0026rsquo;s resolution.\nIt’s okay to not speak on many occasions. Your reaction and response aren’t always required. It initially gives you anxiety, irritation and helplessness because it is tough not to say. However, on the brighter side, it does save you a lot of energy. It teaches you to be patient and tolerant and gives you the ability to let go. We all are blessed with varied inherent characteristics to understand ourselves and the world in a better manner, but how many of us can consciously remember that in this fast-paced life cum rat race? Letting go is a challenging skill to learn and inculcate. But it’s a good natural reminder to slow down and take things easy. Life is wonderful and worth enjoying with a few twists and turns.\nSo, this is how my year ended and started. Something that I never even imagined would happen to me. Interesting, isn’t it, how life surprises you?\nDo share with me how your year ended and began.\nKeep smiling!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post-12/","tags":["Life learning","Raeesa writes","Philosophy","Micro-tale","Life and experience"],"title":"Just try to understand the character, sit back and stop worrying"},{"categories":["Blog writing ","Diary","Life Experiences","Inspiration ","Musing ","Long-form","Philosophy ","Raeesa Writes "],"contents":" “Yes, tell me. . . . okay. Hmmmm. . . okay. Anything else?\nOkay.\nAlright.”\n(phone disconnected or a sign to leave office/place of sitting)\nCan you think of a few names that mostly use such plain, flat, mechanical, and cold words, whether in a phone call or an in-person conversation? Also, the context doesn’t matter. I am sure a few faces may pop up as you read this. Such people leave me deeply upset, but, well, it is who they are. I never look forward to talking to them unless I have to.\nI am sure we have all learned the definition of communication, which is an exchange of information or ideas, but we have never mentioned how. We are not trained to talk, at least professionally, in a decently warm manner. It is left to individual discretion. Those who try speaking in a professionally warm manner are often labelled overtly frank, extreme and stupidly enthusiastic. I am also aware of a few opportunist manipulators who use you in their emotional turmoil for being good to them and never look back once things fall into place. It is not unheard of if you are sensitive and often selflessly land an ear to the distressed ones. I have been there many times. I am sure, so have you.\nI know a few colleagues and so-called friends who have been emotionally empty and cold. I am not talking about introverts or ambiverts or certain stressful times but a breed of emotionally cold beings who intentionally maintain cold plainness in their tone, demeanour and personality with \u0026lsquo;selective people\u0026rsquo;. Selective people include those who seem pretty approachable and have a kind personality. In my professional experience of a decade, these are primarily intentional stunts used by self-centred opportunists by being indifferent and carefully cold for attention-seeking. They also want to keep everyone informed of how worked up they are because of excessive responsibilities. Ironically, the additional tasks that triggered the seasoned and selective rudeness to them are the ones they ask for upfront. They want to do everything by overstretching to the point where it soon hits the personal edge. We are human beings with limited individual personal or professional bandwidth.\nCan you recall a few ‘I am running the universe’ types? Keeping the head over the Earth all the time, unnecessarily? Singing the song of how worked-up and stressed they are because they are singlehandedly running the universe? I feel pity for them. Ironically, you can find these creatures at the workplace and home alike. You can’t even get rid of them. All you can do is learn to live with these braggers. Interesting breed, aren’t they?\nLet me share an instance with you. I phoned a so-called friend a few days ago, sometime in the evening, for professional reasons. I had a good, productive day so far, but that 5-minute cold, plain, mechanical and indifferent conversation put me off so badly that my entire evening was spoilt. I was so irritated and angry that I wanted to phone back and ask for such selective rudeness. But then I was reminded of many such instances that happened regularly over the period where I was given a cold treatment, and the next moment, a cheerful conversation would take place with another person—a selective emotionally cold treatment, you know. Being a sensitive observer, I spotted it in no time. I tried to talk, but there was nothing to talk about. But I intentionally limited my conversations with that person. Something I could do for myself. Huh!\nHowever, this reminds me of a sudden pleasant experience I had a few months ago. I was connected with a professor heading the department through a familiar acquaintance for some work purposes. In our 5 minutes conversation, she said, “Your warmness touches me, and I already want to meet you in person.” It came as a pleasant surprise to me. That one sentence made my day. What did I do to deserve that compliment? Talked professionally in a warm manner. I am sure we both felt good that the conversation took place. And all we did was behave humanely.\nHowever, some people develop mastery in using mechanical, empty, flat, and emotionless demeanour and words with a select bunch of people who can be found readily available at the time of need. These are the ones who may not stoop to the lowest level to remind them of the quick, unquestionable and complete support they provided in their time of need. On the other hand, I have also observed that this self-centred bunch is overly good with a selective bunch. What a pitiful and cautious dual life they always lead for no reason at all unless someone has done wrong to them. The groups we are talking about are selective people pleasers, opportunists, and self-serving lone folk. Let me tell you, these full-of-themselves types do lead good narcissist life. They enjoy living in their small, selective world of superiority where they are the best. What a poor life!\nIronically, they keep themselves away from sharing their feelings of being at the lowest and highest and not-so-good with others. We humans cannot lead a lonely life. Hence, having at least a few people with whom you can share your good and bad days is a good idea. That’s how you can survive as a human being. Remember the theory of Karma? You will reap what you sow!\nSuch people make me never want to talk to them again. I feel like breaking all the ties with them, even professionally. Whenever I speak to them, I know my brightest mood will be spoiled, and the rest of the day or evening will be ruined by thinking about why they had to speak in that tone. Wasn’t it possible to talk a bit nicely? Moreover, a smile lifts our mood, too. I understand that not everyone speaks warmly, but there is always a decent, professionally courteous manner of talking to people. Also, I am talking about so-called highly educated, well-to-do kinds in personal and professional lives. As an academic, I also get a few students of this kind. Emotionally unavailable, flat face, empty from within and mechanical in demeanour.\nI understand that it is impossible to match the vibe with everyone around. Still, I don’t see any apparent harm in exchanging a courteous smile with a familiar face within the boundary of a known landscape or using a decently pleasant tone over a phone call.\nWhat harm can it possibly do? I can’t think of any.\nHow about you?\nThink about it!!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post-1/","tags":["Emotionally cold","Self-centered ","Emotional Manipulators","Opportunist ","Life Learning","Deep Observation "],"title":"Selective Emotionally Cold People: An Interesting Breed"},{"categories":["Personal Development"],"contents":"Hey!\nHope you’re doing well and keeping safe.\nI’ve been in a non-active mode for a while. However, irrespective of what you feel, the world continues to exist and so do the experiences that we get en route. So was the case with me. I have had some intriguing experiences recently and these current experiences took me back into the past, where I had been through similar kinds of experiences. It had brought a sort of deep and blank silence and anxiety to me back then and the same happened to me now, too.\nLet’s come to the point without much do.\nI am going to talk about a specific kind of people who are really good at enacting ‘victim’ after playing their cunning, shrewd, and manipulative schemes on you and hurt you deeply because you stop letting them manipulate you, use you and let them control your life.\nLet me elaborate. You are a smart, intelligent, and sincerely hardworking yet humble person at the professional as well as personal fronts. You believe in the healthy competition being a team player. You believe in the goodness of heart when it comes to handling people around you. Thus, you always give them the benefit of doubt, whenever they misbehave or cross their limit of decency. But, let me tell you, after a careful observation at the later stage when I was coming out of the anxiety, I have realized that these kinds of people are everywhere. They take maximum advantage of your intelligence, knowledge, and skills, try to copy you, use and extremely manipulate you at the personal and professional levels, and consider you a fool. Interestingly enough, the moment you show them their limits in a black and white manner, they play the victim. They create a scenario around in a manner where others may believe that you have done something really bad and wrong to them. You have deeply offended and ill-treated them. All the while, they still have been keeping their goodness.\nI have developed a deep disgust around such people. Such are the people who make you question yourself, your individual characteristics, your very nature, your kindness, honesty, and humbleness and put you in a situation where you begin to justify to your own self that you have not done anything wrong. You have just humble (still humbly yet upfront) made it clear that they can’t interfere and dominate your life, whether personal or professional.\nIt is also to be considered that you never unnecessarily interfere in anyone’s life. You never judge them. You mind your business and never poke your nose in anyone’s personal or professional life. Because you understand that human beings are capable of thinking and taking their decisions independently. Common sense says, everyone is capable of leading their life, in their own individual manner and style. No one, unless requested, requires pointless, extra, unsolicited life advice. Yet, you entertain their nonsense assistances for so long (to ensure they shouldn’t feel bad, if told that I am more than capable enough to handle my life, my way, without your rubbish recommendations and counsel) that a ‘NO’ coming from you leave them uneasy.\nIt hurts their ego to know that how can someone be smarter, intelligent, knowledgeable yet humble? Why are they no more needed to dominate your life? How can you clarify and set healthy boundaries for yourself? How can you begin to realize, understand and acknowledge your self-worth because it is costing you mental disturbance? How dare you not entertain their bullshit and arrogance? How come their enforced and illogical, half-knowledgeable info is unwelcomed now? That too from a person who has always been gentle, considerate, and modest with them? The person who has never hurt their ego because you understand self-esteem is dear to all.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/blog-1/","tags":["Personal Growth","Self-Worth","Self-Esteem"],"title":"The Art of Consciously Understanding Your Self-Worth: 1"},{"categories":["Blog Writing","Diary","Inspiration","Life and Experiences","Long-form","Musing","Philosophy","Raeesa Writes"],"contents":"I hail from a small village in Gujarat and was allowed to pursue further studies as a meritorious female student. Thanks to my parents, who stood up for me against challenging odds in the family and village. I was among a handful of girls in my village to get that opportunity over the years. I started travelling for studies. I couldn’t think beyond studies, actively participating in competitions, winning and losing, but moving forward, humbled and conscious of where I come from, using a fortunate opportunity denied to many of my fellow classmate girls because our village school offered education only till grade 10. We had to travel to a nearby village, about 5 kilometres away, for grades 11 and 12. For graduation, I went to a town about 20 kilometres away. Pursuing studies and travelling in public transport for a village girl is considered taboo even today when I am talking about the early 2000s.\nHence, it could never come to my mind to seek attention, take credit, or compete in the rat race. Villagers lack these “skills.” An introverted village girl has just been happy and excited over the chance to make her life. Ammi taught me ‘neki kar, dariya main daal’ – loosely translated as ‘do (deed) what you can and forget about it\\be discreet with your kindness’. I still firmly believe that ‘let your work speak for you.’ But the world around me is a huge crowd filled with varied people. An interesting kind is ‘Bolbachhans (bol+bachhan = talkers who cannot do anything, that’s why brag).’\nMy experience of over two decades made me realise that the community of Bolbachhans is increasing. They are often called free-riders, intimidators, expert braggers, leg-pullers, mean, self-centred and opportunists. Ironically, their success and happiness depend upon someone’s failure. Further, they Never Work or Contribute. But they are credit-takers for success and first to blame others for failure. They are troubled and internally unhappy people. Unfortunately, they thrive as sadists (sadists get pleasure out of other’s suffering). Please think of them now and laugh at them. They deserve it – Ha, ha, ha! What a pitiful life they have!\nI ask you to laugh off and move forward, but it is not easy in real life. Being around them and having to bear them daily is a challenge. They may make life so miserable for you that you may not want to leave your bed in the morning. They are attention seekers and insecure to the extent that they consciously won’t care how badly they are hurting someone’s self-worth, killing someone’s motivation and even taking away somebody’s job. How many people are crying, feeling lost, and questioning their potential because some opportunist has seeded self-doubt in them repeatedly?\nI see you. I hear you. I feel for you. Because I have been there, too. Despite minding my business, I have been bullied as a student at the hands of my junior during my Master’s course.\nEnglish department organised an international conference. As a sincere, class-ranking, and confident student, I was responsible for handling the stage between sessions to make small announcements in English for tea-lunch breaks and different venues with my junior, a full-of-herself girl. Despite being an excellent and confident orator and winning public speaking competitions, nervousness was natural because I came from a vernacular language (Gujarati) background. Speaking 3 sentences in English in a gathering of the professors of English felt like a gigantic challenge. But I was ready as always. However, the opportunity never came. She grabbed the mike, overshadowed me, and didn’t let me speak despite standing there and waiting for my turn. The repetitive, unspoken insult hit me so deep and hard that I left the event by the evening and skipped the next day. I called in with an excuse for sickness. But this was being observed by fellow students. They brought this issue to a faculty member. Madam called me in and softly enquired about it. I am not the kind that easily opens up or cries in public, but I broke down. Seeing me hurt so deeply she asked me to take the issue to our then-HoD. I don’t know why, but I denied it and asked her to let go. Nevertheless, the situation reached, sir. He first scolded me for not informing him of the entire narrative and silently being bullied. I still remember his words; he said, ‘Never leave a place because someone is insulting you. You are carrying the trust of those who trusted you. Inform them. You are not doing wrong to that girl but standing up for yourself. Never let anyone tell you what you are capable of. There is a reason why you were given the responsibility to handle the stage.” I left teary-eyed from there with a lesson for life.\nIt was in the 2011-2013. A decade later, today, I have created an identity, a place for myself. All by myself. As a curious learner, I have dedication, sincerity and an endless quest for knowledge as an academic. I can sleep peacefully at night when I receive genuine gratitude and acknowledgement from my students for adding value to their lives and being there for them. It is my earning. If this is not an achievement, what is it then?\nHence, feel and accept the roller-coaster phases of life. Try not to be an eraser that wipes out someone’s hard work. Just be there for yourself and remember,\nNeki kar, Dariya main daal and of course, stay awaaaaaaaaay from bolbachhans!!!!\nRecall the value you add to someone’s life. Remember that feeling.\nHave a mindfully relaxing weekend!!!!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/blog-2/","tags":["Bolbachhans","Bragging","Self-Reflection","Personal Growth","Life Lessons"],"title":"Bolbachhans: The Braggers, Not Doers"},{"categories":["Blog Writing","Diary","Inspiration","Life and Experiences","Long-form","Micro-tale","Musing","Philosophy","Raeesa Writes"],"contents":"Ups and downs, rise and fall, pick and pit, highest and lowest, whatever you name, are life’s inevitable parts. We all face hurdles, tests, and moments of trials and doubt in life. It’s natural to stumble and fall, pause and go invisible, but what truly matters is our ability to bounce back. It is what makes you stand out in the crowd.\nBelieving in yourself is not a cliché, as people generally call it. It is instead an essential building block for leading a healthy human life. You’re on the right path to resilience and achievement when you believe in your abilities and trust your capacity to overcome adversity. Also, don’t forget that stating these words is easier than implementing them in the routine. If you’re struggling there, remember we’re all sailing in the same boat. However, you have taken the first step to understand and recognise yourself as you are. Not seeing yourself through other’s eyes, perceptions and opinions.\nSelf-belief helps bring inner motivation to the fore. That thin, almost inaudible inner voice that says, “You can do it,” when the world seems to shout otherwise on your face -centre, left and right. When you believe in yourself, you can struggle through difficult times like a survivor. You begin to develop the resilience to face challenges head-on, knowing that failure is not the end but merely a stepping stone to growth and improvement. Remember, we can’t fail until we try.\nDetermination, trust and belief in ourselves are essential in shaping our mindset. A kind, positive, humane and self-assured outlook towards life and things opens doors to opportunities we barely consider. You become adaptive and let yourself embrace change, novelty and uncertainty with self-belief. It also prepares you to move forward, no matter how disappointed and discouraged you feel for days. It teaches you every day is a new day. We are allowed to do multiple trials and errors as human beings. We also, with time, develop an ability to look forward and get ready to accept an unplanned and sudden future, a sign that we are ready for an upward and new tomorrow.\nSelf-belief, friends, is contagious by nature, like happiness and sadness. Your smiley face may become the reason not only for your day to turn into a good one but also for those who cross paths with you. Friends, just remember that we never lose confidence. We never turn introverts in a fortnight. We don’t lose hope. We don’t fail as a person. We just become conscious and begin to note our surroundings and believe me, it is filled with insecurities, judgements and unhealthy competitions where you either win or lose. Learning and experience barely exist there. We let that gloom and negativity take us over ourselves.\nWe are still the same. For instance, you may lose brain memory in an unfortunate incident, but muscle memory can’t be wiped out. So is the case with us. We exhaust and overwhelm ourselves psychologically by looking at other’s success, progress and eternal happiness and cringe about our inability to compete with the fast-progressing, seemingly always-happy and always-successful world around us. Can you recall the last time you walked 10 minutes to the office or market or did a physically exhausting task? Also, we quickly forget that all of us are struggling in our little worlds. But nobody talks about it or acknowledges it, fearing random public judgements.\nWell, well, well, we still have life in us. We must try to accept it to its fullest -the ups and downs, lows and highs, curves and shapes. Instead of being afraid of failure, how about we consider it an experience, self-learning and a stepping stone?\nSpare a minute today and give this a thought. I am going to do the same.\nHappy Sunday!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/blog-3/","tags":["Self-Belief","Resilience","Determination","Positive Outlook","Life Lessons"],"title":"Cloudy Conversation with the Self"},{"categories":["Go Language","blog writing ","Diary","Life experiences ","Paid laughter ","Emotion-less","Inspiration ","Musing ","Raeesa writes "],"contents":"“I had to pay money to laugh.”\nI was taken aback when these words were spoken by one of my students in class with a plain face and distressed mind. I start my class with an ice-breaking ‘How are you?’ question. In my MBA class, a girl suddenly spoke amid many other voices about a recent stand-up comedy show she attended. The ironic statement unsettled me for a long time. I was clueless as to how I should respond to her. I just wrapped it up with a small smile. The class was about two weeks ago, but I can’t get over it.\nI have been wondering how true it is that, as a society, we are moving forward with a blind upward pace. A race where we barely have time to look at ourselves or sit down with an empty mind, doing nothing. Just sitting and not feeling anxious. Just silent and not overwhelmed. Just having a cup of coffee, feeling relaxed, and gazing at sunrise or sunset without thinking of anything. Whoooooooooh!\nI barely remember the last time I did or felt any of these feelings. What an irony! What a paradox! Adding to the already complex life we are leading, we all have agreed to pay to be able to laugh! What a pity!\nMany things come to us quite naturally. I am sure laughter tops the list. I had never thought I would reach a point so early in my life where I would have to schedule laughter. This makes me introspect deeply. It turns out that I am living in a time when the thin line between surviving and living has gotten thinner for many of us in our late twenties and early thirties. Isn’t it too early to be wholly lost, feeling empty from within, struggling to get up in the morning and forcing ourselves to sleep until almost 2 AM regularly? There are so many questions, mountain-high aspirations, gigantic aims and constant consciousness that ‘Nothing Seems Enough’. Whatever we do to the best of our abilities, the world will have taken a long leap already, and the charm of winning and achieving will have been lost. Hence, the joy of achieving something would have been gone before we could even feel it. Huh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nThis makes me think about our priorities at his juncture– in the late twenties and early thirties. Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, lost, and empty should be considered normal. A normal where I don’t have to upset someone to make myself feel better. A normal where nobody takes pride in being impolite to a colleague, friend or just a classmate to maintain one’s thin ego and take sadistic pleasure.\nWell, I am calling it a day on this note. I don’t want to bore you with longer and longer write-ups. But I am sure, probably, leaving you with the food for thought!\nTake care until we circle back!\nMeanwhile, never forget to smile!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/post-10/","tags":["Paid laughter","Life observations ","Long-form","Self-reflection ","Sharing life"],"title":"Paid Laughter and Not-So-Simple Life"}]
